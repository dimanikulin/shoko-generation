# üéâ PRD: AI Audio Congratulator

## TL;DR
A web/mobile app that turns user-input text, stories, and optional photos into personalized, high-quality audio messages for any celebratory event (birthdays, weddings, retirements, etc.). The AI voice can be fully synthetic or based on a user‚Äôs own recording, with customizable tone and style. Outputs a downloadable audio file for sharing.

## Problem Statement

Writing and recording heartfelt or funny messages is hard ‚Äî many people feel awkward on the mic, or don‚Äôt know what to say. This product makes it effortless by generating warm, personal audio messages using AI voices and personal details, ready to share in minutes.
